Data-Driven Predictive Modeling in R -- Taken at UO

**Overview of the Course:**
This course introduces to basics of programming in R and the fundamentals of predictive modeling. The audience for this course is senior undergraduate and MBA students. Predictive modeling is a sub-field of business analytics. Utilizing historical data and applying various machine learning techniques enables us to develop models that can be used in Regression, Classification, and identifying patterns. A few examples include predicting – a new patient’s length of stay in a hospital outpatient department, used cars sale price, whether a customer accepts a loan, whether a customer commits a credit card fraud, etc.
  
In this course, the main concepts of various techniques include k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Linear Regression, Logistic Regression, Regression-based Forecasting, Classification Trees, Regression Trees, and Cluster Analysis are discussed. Further, we also discuss the theory and implementation of error or accuracy measures, cross-validation, and model selection.
In this course, theoretical concepts of predictive modeling will be supplemented by applying them to real datasets. For this purpose, R software will be used. R is one of the most popular programming languages for statistics/data science; therefore, our objective is to teach programming fundamentals in this language.
  
Students who complete this course will:  
➢ Have fair exposure to introductory programming in R  
➢ Learn the process of managing, cleaning, summarizing, and visualizing real-world datasets in R ➢ Be able to establish the thinking process of defining a real-world data-driven analytics project ➢ Learn theoretical fundamentals of different predictive modeling techniques  
➢ Learn the implementation and inference of the methods in R  
➢ Learn how to evaluate various predictive models and select the model
